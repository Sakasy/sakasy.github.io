> Welcome to the realm of Wikipedia where information flows seamlessly and knowledge is at your fingertips.

Since its creation in 2001, Wikipedia stands as a testament to collective knowledge that transcends geographical and linguistic boundaries. This collaborative online encyclopedia has become a cornerstone of information access for billions worldwide. With millions of articles available in numerous languages, Wikipedia remains a primary gateway to knowledge, facilitating learning and understanding on an unprecedented scale. 

This expansive platform owes much of its success to the dedicated administrators who form the backbone of its operation. These committed volunteers play a pivotal role in fostering a collaborative and high-quality environment. Administrators are entrusted with crucial responsibilities, including maintaining content standards, resolving disputes, and safeguarding the encyclopedia from vandalism, copyright problems and misinformation. 

Now dear reader, if you find yourself drawn to the idea of contributing at a more impactful level within the Wikipedia community, you might be contemplating taking the step towards becoming a Wikipedia administrator. 

First, you should know that there are no official prerequisites; any registered user can request administrator privileges. However, you are expected to be active, experienced, and trusted members of the community. So if you are interested, you can easily apply for Wikipedia administrator status by submitting a request for adminship (RfA). Subsequently, any Wikipedia member may cast a supporting, neutral, or opposing vote for you. 

As you embark on this journey, it's essential to understand the intricacies of the election process and equip yourself with valuable insights to enhance your candidacy. In the following sections, we'll guide you through the adminship election process, offering tips and advice to help you navigate the path toward becoming an esteemed Wikipedia administrator.

### Let’s uncover General Trends of Elections…
The dataset captures a decade-long snapshot of Wikipedia's Request for Adminship (RFA) elections, from 2003 to May 2013. By examining the details of these elections, we may uncover some patterns that can offer valuable insights. Therefore, before providing you with some useful tips for a successful election, let's first analyze the general trends of the elections. While doing so, we will try to answer several important questions, providing a comprehensive understanding of the landscape.

##### How has the amount of elections changed over time? Are there consistent trends in the distribution of won and lost elections across different years?

To make it easier to compare, let’s plot a yearly pie-chart of won and lost elections percentages from 2003 to 2013.


Examining the chart reveals that the early years of the wiki-RfA process, up to 2005, boasted a notably high acceptance rate—hitting 100% and 80.3% for 2003 and 2004, respectively. However, starting from 2006, coinciding with the growing number of candidates mentioned in the paragraph above, the acceptance rate began to drop drastically, reaching a mere 30% in 2012.
It's crucial to note that the data for 2013 only covers up to May, making the acceptance rate for this year less representative of the overall scenario.
With an average acceptance rate of 38% from 2006 to 2012, it's evident that adminship has become highly selective. So, remember the saying: many are called, but few are chosen. Getting that admin badge won't be a walk in the park; preparation is key to standing out as a strong candidate. Are you up for the challenge?

##### What is the Average Number of Votes Received in Wikipedia RFA Elections Over the Years ?
By examining the trend of the average number of votes per election over the years, you can gain insight into the anticipated vote count you might receive in the future during the voting process.

You might think that every election generates the same interest in the Wikipedia community, but it turns out that voter interest varies significantly across elections. In fact, excluding the year 2013, which has the lowest number of elections recorded in our dataset and is not the most representative, 25% of the elections in a given year have fewer than 20 voters participating. Some elections even have only one voter.

It's important to note that, according to the data we found on [the Guide to Requests for Adminship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Guide_to_requests_for_adminship#Closure) in the closure section, the page  states that a bureaucrat will close the RfA as soon as it is feasible. This could be hours or even a day or two after the formal closing date. Additionally, our research indicates that several candidates withdraw their own candidacy shortly after the beginning of the election. But don't let that worry you; every year, there are a few outlier candidates who generate above and beyond interest. In one election, for the candidate 'TenPoundHammer,' an outstanding number of 561 votes were recorded.
